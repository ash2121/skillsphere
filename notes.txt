State is a class actually

on is a general method
on method takes a type of event
on<event_class_name>((event, emit){});

Emitter callable class:
>we call emit to release state for ui where we say that our ui has changed
>we can call it anything, no need to call it only emit
> emit is an instance of Emitter class which is a callable class
>emit is called like a function
>we can call this class just like a function because inside this class we have a call method

welcome.dart -> ui 
bloc -> business logic
starting with welcome.dart or ui


if multiple floating vuttons are present, we can give them different heroTags to differentiate

if you have multiple blocProviders, one only will be created immediately and generally it is the first one in the list of blocProviders. We can overide this : set lazy = false. Generate as soon as possible. Using lazy, we can create particular blocs first. this is memory efficient.

pushAndRemoveUntil ---> keep removing all the routes until u hit the mentioned one. Also required to mention routes property in homepage --> used here for onboarding screens


we use classes as events and not varibles or methods

we need to have abstract class as event class so that it can be extended by another class
